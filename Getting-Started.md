# Getting started
## As a user

Requirements:
- Visual Studio 2022 or later
- Cosmos OS User-kit (https://www.gocosmos.org/download/)
	- VMWare
- Source code (Download from here)

Open the solution and `Cosmos` next to the green triangle facing right at the top.
This should open a VMWare VM after a while and will take you into the OS!
